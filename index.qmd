  2.The vegetation area before and after the conflict was calculated, and the change of vegetation area before and after the war was shown using line plots.
  3.Draw all the month layers as GIFs.
  4.Click the GIF download button to complete the GIF download.

## How it Works 

Use this section to explain how your application works using code blocks and text explanations (no more than 500 words excluding code):

```js
Map.setCenter(35.51898, 33.90153, 15);

Map.setOptions("satellite");

var aoi = ee.Geometry.Point(35.51898, 33.90153).buffer(3000);
```


#Interface
Firstly,  Create a map instance and Set the center point and zoom level of the map
```js
// Create a map instance
var map1 = ui.Map();
// Set the center point and zoom level of the map
map1.centerObject(aoi,10.5);
```

You can include images:

and math:
$$ \Large t = {\frac{\overline{x_1}-\overline{x_2}} {\sqrt{\frac{s^2_1}{n_1} + \frac{s^2_2}{n_2}}}} $$
